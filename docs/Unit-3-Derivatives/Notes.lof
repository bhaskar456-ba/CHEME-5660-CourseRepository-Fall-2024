\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {6}{\ignorespaces Schematic of the profit for a short straddle trade written for Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. with ticker symbol \texttt {AMD}. A short straddle is a neutral strategy constructed by simultaneously selling a put and a call option on the same underlying asset \texttt {AMD}, with the same expiration and strike price. Conversely, a long straddle is a neutral strategy constructed by simultaneously buying a put and a call option on the same underlying asset \texttt {AMD}, with the same expiration and strike price. A long straddle has the same breakeven points as a short straddle, but the profit and loss are reversed, i.e., the profit diagram is rotated around the breakeven line. Thus, a long straddle has a defined maximum loss and an unlimited maximum possible profit. }}{15}{figure.caption.16}%

A short strangle is a neutral, undefined risk strategy constructed by simultaneously selling a put and a call option on the same underlying asset \texttt {AMD}, with the same expiration but different strike prices. On the other hand, a long strangle is a neutral strategy constructed by simultaneously buying a put and a call option on the same underlying asset \texttt {AMD}, with the same expiration but different strike prices.
